# Design Tokens Extractor

Extract design tokens from Figma and write them back. Two flows: **Extract** (Figma to Code) and **Write-back** (Code to Figma).

## Step 1: Mode Selection

Ask the user:

```
What would you like to do?

   A) Extract tokens from Figma → generate JSON, CSS, SCSS files
   B) Write tokens back to Figma → push local tokens.json into Figma variables
```

If the user's initial message already makes the intent clear (e.g., "extract my design tokens"), skip this question and proceed directly.

## Step 2: Format Selection

Present the format choice with descriptions and a concrete example of the same token in each format:

```
Which token naming convention?

   A) W3C DTCG — Modern W3C standard (Style Dictionary v4+, Tokens Studio)
      Component/context leads, property at the end.
      Uses $value, $type, $description fields.

      Example — button primary background hover:
        Path:  button.accent.bg.color.hover
        JSON:  { "$value": "{bg.brand.color.hover}", "$type": "color" }

   B) CTI — Category/Type/Item (Style Dictionary v3 default)
      Physical property leads, component in the middle.
      Uses value, type, comment fields.

      Example — button primary background hover:
        Path:  color.button.bg.accent.hover
        JSON:  { "value": "{color.bg.brand.hover}", "type": "color" }
```

After the user chooses, read the corresponding format reference for detailed structure:
- W3C: `references/w3c-format.md`
- CTI: `references/cti-format.md`

## Step 3: Access Method

**Before choosing the access method, ask the user what Figma plan their org is on.** This is critical because the Figma Variables REST API is **Enterprise-only**.

```
What Figma plan is your organization on?

   1) Starter / Professional / Organization
   2) Enterprise
   3) Not sure — I'll check
```

If the user answers **1 (non-Enterprise)**:
- The REST API cannot read or write Figma Variables (`file_variables:*` scopes don't exist on their plan)
- Recommend the **Figma Desktop MCP path** (works on all plans)
- OR offer **styles-only REST extraction** (typography, effects, color styles — no variables)
- Write-back is not available

If the user answers **2 (Enterprise)**:
- Both MCP and REST API paths work
- Write-back via REST API is available

If the user answers **3 (not sure)**: have them check `figma.com/settings → Personal access tokens → Create new token`. If "File variables" appears as a scope checkbox, they're on Enterprise. If not, they're on a lower tier.

Then present the access method:

```
How to connect to Figma?

   A) Figma Desktop MCP — Figma app must be open (read-only, works on any plan)
   B) REST API — Personal Access Token (Enterprise required for variables; other plans only get styles/nodes)
```

**MCP path:** Use `mcp__Figma__get_variable_defs` and `mcp__Figma__get_design_context`. The Figma desktop app must have the target file open. MCP tools are read-only — cannot write back.

**REST API path (Enterprise):** Prompt for `FIGMA_TOKEN` with scopes `file_variables:read`, `file_variables:write` (if writing back), `file_content:read`.

**REST API path (non-Enterprise, styles-only):** Prompt for `FIGMA_TOKEN` with just `file_content:read`. Skip the `/variables/local` call; use only `/styles` and `/nodes` endpoints. The output will include typography, effects, and color styles but NOT Figma Variables.

**Important:** Write-back flow always requires REST API on **Enterprise**.

Read `references/figma-api.md` for endpoint details and plan requirements table.

## Step 4: Collect Figma Files

Ask the user for one or more Figma file URLs or file keys. Extract the file key from URLs:
- `https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/<name>` → extract `<fileKey>`
- `https://www.figma.com/file/<fileKey>/<name>` → extract `<fileKey>`
- For branch URLs `.../branch/<branchKey>/...` → use `<branchKey>`

Support multiple files (e.g., one for colors, one for components, one for typography).

## Extract Flow (Figma → Code)

### E1: Fetch Raw Data — Variables & Styles

**REST API path** — for each file key, run:

```bash
# Variables (collections, modes, values)
curl -s -H "X-FIGMA-TOKEN: $FIGMA_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.figma.com/v1/files/<KEY>/variables/local"

# Styles metadata (paint, text, effect, grid)
curl -s -H "X-FIGMA-TOKEN: $FIGMA_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.figma.com/v1/files/<KEY>/styles"

# Resolve style values via node IDs (batch node IDs from styles response)
curl -s -H "X-FIGMA-TOKEN: $FIGMA_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.figma.com/v1/files/<KEY>/nodes?ids=<comma-separated-node-ids>"
```

**MCP path** — for each file, call:
- `mcp__Figma__get_variable_defs` (variables and their modes)
- `mcp__Figma__get_design_context` (component structure, applied styles)
- `mcp__Figma__get_metadata` (enumerate pages and components)

Read `references/figma-api.md` for full response schemas and rate limit handling.

### E2: Introspect Master Components

**This step is critical.** Variables alone only give you primitive raw values. The semantic and component token layers must be derived from how master components actually use those values.

**Step E2.1: Enumerate ALL master components across ALL pages.**

A Figma file can have multiple pages, each containing different component groups. The skill MUST scan every page — not just the currently visible one.

**REST API path (preferred — scans the entire file automatically):**
```bash
# Get all components in the file (all pages)
curl -s -H "X-FIGMA-TOKEN: $FIGMA_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.figma.com/v1/files/<KEY>/components"

# Get full file tree to enumerate pages and find component sets
curl -s -H "X-FIGMA-TOKEN: $FIGMA_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.figma.com/v1/files/<KEY>?depth=2"
```

The `/components` endpoint returns ALL published components across all pages. The `/files/:key?depth=2` call returns the page structure — each top-level child of the document is a page. Use page names to understand grouping (e.g., "Buttons", "Inputs", "Feedback", "Navigation").

**MCP path (requires manual page navigation):**
1. Call `mcp__Figma__get_metadata` with the file's root page ID (`0:1`) to list all pages.
2. For EACH page, call `mcp__Figma__get_metadata` with the page's nodeId to list its top-level frames and components.
3. Collect all component/component-set node IDs across all pages.
4. Important: the user may need to navigate to each page in Figma desktop for MCP to access its contents. Ask the user to switch pages if needed.

Build a component inventory table:

```
Page: "Buttons"
  - Button (component set, node 129:10493) — variants: Type, State, Size
  - IconButton (component set, node 130:200) — variants: State, Size

Page: "Forms"  
  - Input (component set, node 200:100) — variants: State, Size, HasLabel
  - Checkbox (component, node 201:50) — variants: State
  - Radio (component, node 202:30) — variants: State
  ...
```

**Step E2.2: For each master component, inspect its variant properties.**

Figma components have variant properties (visible as the property panel fields). Common properties and their token mapping:

| Figma Variant Property | Token Dimension | Examples |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| `Type` / `Variant` / `Style` | Role | primary, secondary, tertiary, ghost, danger |
| `State` | State | default, hover, active, focus, disabled |
| `Size` | Size modifier | xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl |
| `Theme` / `Mode` | Theme | light, dark |
| `Icon` / `Leading` / `Trailing` | Element | icon, label, leading, trailing |

**MCP path:** Call `mcp__Figma__get_design_context` with the `nodeId` of each master component. This returns the component rendered as code with applied colors, spacing, and typography visible in the output. Parse the generated code to extract:
- Background colors (`bg-[#...]` or `bg-[var(--...)]`)
- Text colors (`text-[#...]`)
- Border/stroke colors and widths
- Border radius values
- Padding/gap values
- Font properties (family, weight, size, line-height)
- Shadow/effect values

**REST API path:** Use `GET /v1/files/:key/nodes?ids=<component-node-id>` to get full node properties including fills, strokes, effects, cornerRadius, padding, and bound variables.

**Step E2.3: Walk the variant matrix.**

For each component, iterate through its variant combinations. The goal is to capture how each property changes across variants and states:

Example — **Button** component with variants `Type=[Primary, Secondary, Ghost]` and `State=[Default, Hover, Active, Disabled]`:

```
Button / Primary / Default  → bg: #275ECE, text: #FFFFFF, radius: 8, shadow: primary-button-regular
Button / Primary / Hover    → bg: #1D4BA0, text: #FFFFFF
Button / Primary / Active   → bg: #143B71, text: #FFFFFF
Button / Primary / Disabled → bg: #275ECE (16% opacity), text: #FFFFFF (40% opacity)
Button / Secondary / Default → bg: transparent, border: #E1E4E4, text: #16181D
...
```

**MCP path:** Select specific variant instances in Figma (or navigate to the variant's node ID) and call `get_design_context` for each. If the component has many variants, prioritize: extract one representative per Type, and Default + Hover + Disabled states for each.

**REST API path:** Fetch the component set node, then iterate child component nodes (each represents a variant). Parse their properties.

### E3: Classify Tokens into 3 Layers

Use the data from E1 (raw variables) and E2 (component introspection) together.

**Primitive (Layer 1)** — raw design values, no semantic meaning:
- Color palette scales (e.g., `accent/500`, `neutrals-d/900`)
- Spacing/radius numeric scales
- Font family, weight, and size primitives
- Raw effect values
- Classification: variables with NO aliases, raw hex/number values, typically in single-mode collections named "Primitives", "Raw", "Core", "Base", "Palette", "Scale"

**Semantic (Layer 2)** — contextual roles derived from how primitives are used across multiple components:
- Look at the extracted component data: if the SAME primitive value appears as background across multiple components (Button primary, Badge primary, Link primary), it becomes a semantic `color-bg-brand` token referencing that primitive.
- If a value appears as text color on a colored surface across multiple components, it becomes `color-text-on-brand`.
- Feedback colors used consistently (success/warning/alert states across components) become semantic feedback tokens.
- Common padding/radius values used across multiple components become semantic spacing/radius tokens.
- Pattern detection:

| Observation across components | Semantic token |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| Same bg color for all "primary" variants | `color-bg-brand` → `{color.primitive.accent.500}` |
| Same bg color for "primary hover" | `color-bg-brand-hover` → `{color.primitive.accent.600}` |
| White text on all colored backgrounds | `color-text-on-brand` → `{color.primitive.basic.white}` |
| Same dark text color for body text | `color-text-primary` → `{color.primitive.neutrals-d.900}` |
| Same muted text color | `color-text-secondary` → `{color.primitive.neutrals-d.400}` |
| Same border color across inputs/cards | `color-border-default` → `{color.primitive.neutrals-l.300}` |
| Same disabled opacity pattern | `color-bg-disabled` → `{color.opacity.accent-500.16}` |
| Common radius across default buttons/inputs | `radius-default` → references a primitive |
| Common padding across containers | `spacing-padding-md` → references a primitive |

**Component (Layer 3)** — component-specific tokens for values unique to a single component:
- If a value is used ONLY by one component (not shared), it becomes a component token.
- Component tokens reference semantic tokens where possible, primitives as fallback.
- Naming includes the component: `color-button-bg-primary`, `radius-button-small-md`, `shadow-primary-button-regular`.
- Per-breakpoint values (md, lg, xl, 2xl) are always component tokens since they're component-specific responsive behavior.

**Fallback:** If a value can't be traced to a component or semantic role, classify as primitive. Ask the user to confirm ambiguous cases.

### E4: Apply Naming Convention

Read `references/naming-rules.md` for the full taxonomy (categories, properties, roles, prominence, states).

**Key rules:**
- Convert Figma `/` separator to `.` for JSON nesting, `-` for CSS/SCSS
- Omit `default` state from names (it's implied)
- Use `on-{role}` prefix for content on colored surfaces
- Convert Figma RGBA (0-1) to hex: `#${Math.round(r*255).toString(16).padStart(2,'0')}${...g...}${...b...}`
- If alpha < 1, append alpha hex byte
- Map Figma variant property values to token name segments:
  - `Type=Primary` → role `primary` or `brand`
  - `Type=Secondary` → role `secondary`
  - `Type=Ghost` → role `ghost`
  - `Type=Danger` → role `danger`
  - `State=Hover` → state `-hover`
  - `State=Disabled` → state `-disabled`
  - `Size=md` → size modifier `-md`

### E4: Merge Multi-Theme Modes

For each multi-mode collection:
1. Identify the default mode (usually "Light" or the collection's `defaultModeId`)
2. Default mode values go into the main token tree
3. Other modes go into a `themes` section (JSON) or `[data-theme="<mode>"]` selectors (CSS)
4. Primitive tokens are shared — they do NOT vary per theme
5. Static tokens (e.g., `color-static-white`) are excluded from theme overrides

### E5: Generate Output Files

Read `references/output-templates.md` for exact templates and formatting rules.

Generate 4 files in the output directory (default `./design-tokens/`):

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `tokens.json` | Full token tree in chosen format (W3C or CTI) |
| `tokens.css` | CSS custom properties with `:root` and `[data-theme]` selectors |
| `tokens.scss` | SCSS variables, theme maps, and theme mixin |
| `style-dictionary.config.json` | Style Dictionary build config pointing to tokens.json |

Ask the user for the output directory path. Default to `./design-tokens/`.

### E6: Self-Check — Validate Before Writing

**MANDATORY.** Before writing any output file, review the generated token structure against this checklist. Read `references/naming-rules.md` section "Disambiguation: Radius vs Spacing" if needed.

**Category assignment checks:**
- [ ] **Radius vs Spacing:** Variables with small numeric values (4-18px) that vary per breakpoint — are they `radius` or `spacing`? Check the Figma variable name, sibling tokens in the same collection, and Figma scopes. If the variable sits in a collection alongside `Radius-*` tokens, it is radius. If it sits alongside `Padding-*` or `Gap-*` tokens, it is spacing. Never assume based on value alone.
- [ ] **Spacing vs Size:** `width`/`height` values are `size`, not `spacing`. Only padding, margin, and gap are `spacing`.
- [ ] **Font size vs Dimension:** Font sizes should be under `font.size`, not generic `dimension` or `spacing`.
- [ ] **Opacity colors vs Solid colors:** Hex values with alpha (e.g., `#FFFFFF1F`) should be under `color.opacity`, not mixed into the main palette.
- [ ] **Effect tokens category:** Drop shadows are `shadow`, not `color`. Inner shadows are also `shadow` (with `inset` prefix in CSS).

**Naming consistency checks:**
- [ ] **No duplicate paths:** Verify no two tokens resolve to the same CSS variable name.
- [ ] **Consistent separator:** All JSON keys use the same nesting style (no mix of `.` and `/`).
- [ ] **No `default` in state names:** `color-bg-primary` not `color-bg-primary-default`.
- [ ] **Breakpoint suffixes consistent:** If using `md/lg/xl/2xl`, all groups use the same set — no random `xs` in one group and `sm` in another unless the Figma data supports it.

**Cross-format checks (CSS/SCSS must match JSON):**
- [ ] Every token in `tokens.json` has a corresponding entry in `tokens.css` and `tokens.scss`.
- [ ] CSS variable names match the JSON token path (replace `.` with `-`, add `--` prefix).
- [ ] SCSS variable names match (`$` prefix instead of `--`).
- [ ] Shadow values in CSS are valid `box-shadow` syntax (not broken across lines).

**Structural checks:**
- [ ] Alias references in JSON actually point to existing tokens (no dangling `{color.primitive.foo}` that doesn't exist).
- [ ] Typography composite tokens have all required fields (fontFamily, fontWeight, fontSize, lineHeight, letterSpacing).
- [ ] No empty groups in JSON (every nested object eventually contains a token with a `value`).

If any check fails, fix it before writing the files. If unsure about a classification, flag it in the warnings summary and ask the user.

## Write-Back Flow (Code → Figma)

### W1: Collect Inputs

Prompt for:
1. Path to local `tokens.json` file
2. Target Figma file URL or key (where to write)
3. Figma PAT (if not already set)

### W2: Parse and Validate

Read the JSON file and auto-detect format:
- Has `$value` fields → W3C DTCG
- Has `value` fields (no `$` prefix) → CTI

Validate:
- All alias references resolve to existing tokens
- No circular alias chains
- Token types are valid
- Report any issues before proceeding

### W3: Fetch Current Figma State

Call `GET /v1/files/:key/variables/local` to get existing variables. Build lookup maps:
- `{collectionName → collectionId}`
- `{variablePath → variableId}` (convert Figma `/` names to dot paths)
- `{modeName → modeId}` per collection

### W4: Compute Diff

Compare local tokens against Figma state:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| CREATE | Token exists locally but not in Figma |
| UPDATE | Token exists in both but values differ |
| UNCHANGED | Token exists in both with same values |
| FIGMA-ONLY | Token exists in Figma but not locally (leave untouched) |

### W5: Preview and Confirm

Display the diff summary:

```
Write-Back Preview (dry run)

  Collections:  1 to create (Components), 2 unchanged
  Variables:    12 to create, 5 to update, 130 unchanged
  Modes:        1 to create (High Contrast), 2 unchanged

  New variables:
    - button/bg/accent-disabled (COLOR)
    - button/text/accent-disabled (COLOR)
    ...

  Updated values:
    - color/bg/brand: #4B64FF → #3B5BDB (Light mode)
    ...

  Proceed? (y/n)
```

**Never auto-push.** Wait for explicit user confirmation.

### W6: Push Changes

Read `references/figma-api.md` for the POST request body schema.

Build a single `POST /v1/files/:key/variables` request body with:
1. `variableCollections`: CREATE new collections
2. `variableModes`: CREATE new modes in existing/new collections
3. `variables`: CREATE new variables, UPDATE changed ones
4. `variableModeValues`: Set values per variable per mode

**Ordering:** Create collections first, then modes, then primitive variables, then semantic variables (which alias primitives), then component variables (which alias semantics). Use temporary IDs (`temp-col-1`, `temp-var-1`, etc.) for new items — Figma resolves them.

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "X-FIGMA-TOKEN: $FIGMA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '<JSON_BODY>' \
  "https://api.figma.com/v1/files/<KEY>/variables"
```

### W7: Display Results

```
Write-Back Complete

  Created: 1 collection, 1 mode, 12 variables
  Updated: 5 variables
  Errors:  0

  View in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/<KEY>/

## Reference Files

Load these on-demand as needed during execution — do NOT preload all at startup.

| File | When to load |
|------|-------------|
| `references/w3c-format.md` | After user chooses W3C DTCG format |
| `references/cti-format.md` | After user chooses CTI format |
| `references/figma-api.md` | Before making any API calls (extract or write-back) |
| `references/naming-rules.md` | During token classification and naming (step E3) |
| `references/output-templates.md` | When generating output files (step E5) |

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| HTTP 403 on `/variables/local` or `POST /variables` | Likely means the Figma org is NOT on Enterprise plan. The `file_variables:*` scopes only exist on Enterprise. Offer: switch to MCP path, or continue with styles-only extraction via `/styles` + `/nodes` |
| HTTP 403 on `/styles` or `/nodes` | PAT is missing `file_content:read`. Ask user to regenerate the PAT with that scope |
| HTTP 429 (rate limited) | Read `Retry-After` header, wait, retry. Batch requests to minimize calls |
| HTTP 404 | File key is invalid or user lacks access |
| MCP tools unavailable | Fall back to REST API path. Prompt for PAT |
| Invalid/unparseable JSON (write-back) | Show parse error location, ask user to fix |
| Circular alias detected | Report the cycle (A → B → A), skip those tokens, warn user |
| Unresolved alias reference | Skip the token, include in warnings summary |
